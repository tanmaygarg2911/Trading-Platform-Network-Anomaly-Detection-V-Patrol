## Methodology 🧪

The V-Patrol project follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition 📥:** Obtain network traffic data and device metadata from relevant sources.
2.  **Feature Extraction ⚙️:** Extract key features from the raw data, including:
    *   Request frequencies, device contribution ratios, and burstiness metrics.
    *   IP geolocation data and device location information.
    *   User-Agent strings and device metadata.
3.  **Data Preprocessing 🧹:** Clean and normalize the data to ensure data quality and consistency.
4.  **Feature Engineering 🛠️:** Create new features to enhance anomaly detection capabilities (e.g., rolling unique counts, difference calculations).
5.  **Model Training 🏋️:** Train an Isolation Forest model to identify anomalies based on the extracted and engineered features.
6.  **Model Evaluation ✅:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., silhouette score) and visualizations.
7.  **Iterative Refinement 🔄:** Refine the model by adjusting hyperparameters, selecting relevant features, and exploring alternative modeling techniques.
8.  **Deployment (Optional) 🚀:** Deploy the trained model for real-time anomaly detection in a production environment.

## Feature Analysis 🕵️

### Network Traffic Metrics 🌐

*   **Requests Per Device Per Second:** Used to identify devices generating unusually high traffic, indicating malicious activity or misconfiguration.
*   **Device Contribution Ratio:** Helps identify dominant devices and assess their impact on network load.
*   **Burstiness Analysis:** Detects irregular traffic patterns that may signal botnet activity or automated scanning.

### Anomaly Detection Features 🚨

The model also accounts for certain anomalies which includes:
*   **Height and Width Mismatch.**
*   **IP Address Count Difference & Carrier Count Difference.**
*   **Carrier Count Difference & App Bundle Count Difference.**
*   **Impossible IPs & Country Code Mismatch.**
*   **Country Code Mismatch & Normalized Distance.**
*   **IP Address Count Diff & Connection Type Count Diff.**

### Device Data Cleaning and Anomaly Detection 📱

*   **Missing Vendor Information:** Flags devices lacking vendor details, potentially indicating anonymization.
*   **Device Consistency Checks:** Identifies inconsistencies in OS, OS version, height, and width.
*   **OS Version Normalization:** Flags mismatches between OS version and normalized OS version.

### IP Address and Carrier Data Cleaning 📡

*   **Missing Carrier Information Detection:** Identifies rows where carrier information is missing.
*   **Impossible IP Addresses:** Flags fake or invalid IP addresses.
*   **Country Code Mismatch Detection:** Flags mismatches between IP-based geolocation and device country code.

### IP Geolocation and Distance Normalization 📍

*   **Haversine Distance Calculation:** Measures the distance between device GPS coordinates and IP-based geolocation.
*   **Distance Normalization:** Normalizes Haversine distances for comparison.

### Rolling Unique Counts 🔄

*   **Rolling counts on diverse features**: A pandas rolling window was created to make a count of distinct IP addresses, carrier networks, app bundles, and connections per minute.

### BERT-Based Embedding and Similarity 💬

*   **BERT Embeddings:** Uses natural language processing to generate vector representations of User-Agent (UA) strings and device metadata.
*   **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates the cosine similarity between UA and metadata embeddings to detect mismatches.

These helped detect :
*   **Device spoofing is suggested by strong correlations between height and width mismatches. 📱**
*   **Geo-spoofing is potentially indicated by impossible IPs and country mismatches. 📍**
*   **Normal network behavior can account for some changes, such as IP and connection type differences for mobile users. 📶**

    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies 🐍:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🚀

1.  **Data Preparation 📝:** Ensure your network traffic data is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, Excel). Place your data files in the `data/` directory.

2.  **Run the Analysis 🏃:**

    *   Utilize the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to perform feature extraction, data analysis, and model training.
    *   Alternatively, run the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory to automate specific tasks.

    *   Examine the model outputs and anomaly reports.

## Future Scope 🔮

V-Patrol is always improving! Here are some possible extensions to add in. Contributors are Welcome!:

*   **Neural Network Models:** Investigate the application of neural network models, such as autoencoders, to better capture temporal dependencies and identify more subtle anomalies.
*   **Reconstruction Error Analysis:** Utilize the reconstruction error from autoencoders to identify anomalies. Higher reconstruction errors for temporal data will imply the data point as anomalies.
